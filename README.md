##Troubleshooting
If you are using Mac OSX and get an error with text like "Intel HAXM is required to run this AVD. /dev/kvm is not found"
Do the following steps to fix:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46565353/dev-kvm-is-not-found-on-mac-os

Do note that once the emulator is running, its process thread  will need to be stopped with a separate command.
 The IDE will NOT do this task.
